Notes:

* I still don't know what is the "right way" to structure Flux resources
    in a repository.
* I still don't have my working laptop, I'm using a remote server to do
    everything. They promised I can get back this week, and chip shortage
    is painful.
* I use Traefik on my personal clusters as well on my Docker Swarm platform.
* I did not even know Flagger exists before it was mentioned.
