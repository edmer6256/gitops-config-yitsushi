## Anatomy of a Canary

* It has a `Namespace`.
* It has a target, in this case a `Deployment`.
* It can have an `autoscaler` target.
* It has a `Service` definition. This will be out target `Service` in our
    `IngressRoute`.
* It has a bunch of other properties....

### Target

spec:
  targetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: hello-world
  autoscalerRef:
    apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
    kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler

```
