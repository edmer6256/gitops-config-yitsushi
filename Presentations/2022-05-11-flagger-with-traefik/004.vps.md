## Deploy Traefik

* I'm using CloudFlare as the TLS resolver.
  * Add Secret.
* Add Helm Repository.
* Add Help Release.

Notes:

* Flagger docs told me to add Prometheus annotation. It was there already.
    I was not able to find why, I expected it will add that annotation
    automatically when the metrics endpoint is enabled, but it does not
    seem the case based on the Helm chart. Anyway, it's there, if I add
    it cries for duplicated entries.
