## Thoughts

* Flagger is awesome. I'll definitely use it.
* We can use the Status field to get information about the deployment

    ```yaml
    status:
      canaryWeight: 0
      conditions:
        - lastTransitionTime: "2022-05-11T13:54:51Z"
          lastUpdateTime: "2022-05-11T13:54:51Z"
          message: Canary analysis completed successfully, promotion finished.
          reason: Succeeded
          status: "True"
          type: Promoted
      failedChecks: 1
      iterations: 0
      lastAppliedSpec: "5978589476"
      lastPromotedSpec: "5978589476"
      lastTransitionTime: "2022-05-11T13:54:51Z"
      phase: Succeeded
    ```

* There is an option to set up an `EventWebhook` in case we want to syncronize
    canary deployments across clusters, but that would require some state
    management in WGE, and potentially needs chanes in Flagger too.

    For example on successful rollout, wait for a manual approval before
    finalizing the deployment, when all clusters come back with success, WGE
    can call out to finalize everywhere.

    ```bash
    helm upgrade -i flagger flagger/flagger \
        --set eventWebhook=https://wge.domain.tld/canary-event-webhook
    ```
