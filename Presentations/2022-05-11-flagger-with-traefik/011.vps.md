## Roll out a new version

* New container images are ready to use when a git tag is created, thanks to
    GitHub Actions.
* Update Deployment with the new tag.
* Commit and Push changes.
* Flux magic again.
* Flagger will create a new Service and route traffic to that Service.
* Our application is up to date.


What happens if a deployment failed? Flagger will roll back the changes.
